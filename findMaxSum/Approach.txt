One is expected to find the maximum sum with the given pyramid shaped input

A Naive Recursive approach would easily solve the problem with below steps:
  -Calculate the sum recursively for both left and the right indexes from the very beginning
      - Make sure you are not dealing with a coordinate which contains a prime number

  -Compare left & right summations, return the maximum...
